NBA 2K Audio Editor
	by Lefteris "Leftos" Aslanoglou and nesa24

	Quick Notes
		With the amazing research and perseverance shown by nesa24 from the NLSC forums in figuring out NBA 2K's audio format, I was able to build this tool to allow us to edit the audio files of NBA 2K.


	Features
		- Allows users to edit all NBA 2K BIN Audio files as long as they're in the 2K11/2K12/2K13 format
		- Automatically encodes MP3 and WAV files to the right format
		- Only allows the user to replace songs that are longer than the user-selected song; any remaining duration is automatically filled with silence

					
	Known Issues
		- There's a bit of skipping (like twice in 2 minutes, from my testing), some more research needs to be done on that matter.
		
		
	Disclaimer
		As with any editing tool, you should always keep backups of any files you edit. There might be bugs I am not aware of, and new features might bring new bugs of their own. So always, always keep backups. I will not be held responsible for any corruption caused to your files.
